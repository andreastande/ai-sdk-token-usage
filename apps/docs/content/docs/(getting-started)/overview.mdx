AI SDK Token Usage is a lightweight TypeScript library designed to help developers 
accurately measure and visualize token usage across different AI model providers.
The library is targeted for developers using AI SDK with React.

Whether youâ€™re integrating OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or other providers, the library 
abstracts away provider-specific differences so you can focus on building AI-powered 
applications with clear insights into cost and context window utilization.

The open-source model database [models.dev](https://models.dev) is used to retrieve up-to-date
pricing and limits, with plans to support more registries soon such as OpenRouter.
